# Specification Quality Checklist: Default home landing and Settings navigation

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2026-04-22  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- **Validation (2026-04-22)**: All items pass. No `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION]` markers. Key Entities section omitted intentionally (no new persisted entities). Constitution note: primary in-gym logging journey is not advanced by this feature; shell/navigation and discoverability of existing Lift management are the scope. Future specs should continue to prioritize the logging journey when that work ships.
